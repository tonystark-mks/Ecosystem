Start flume on x Master node
* Install service flume on Cloudera and configure agent on CM host

* In CM Goto -> Flume -> Configuration 
  Set the Agent Name property to MyAgent
  In 'Configuration File' Enter the following configuration

----**** Create HDFS directory for flume sink ****-----
Conect to any worker node
su hdfs
hdfs dfs -mkdir /user/flume/
hdfs dfs -chown -R flume:flume /user/flume
hdfs dfs -chmod -R 770 /user/flume

----**** Start the agent ****-----
Connect to x Master node where flume is present
cd /opt/cloudera/parcels : ls -- check the parcel name

sudo /opt/cloudera/parcels/CDH-6.3.3-1.cdh6.3.3.p0.1796617/etc/init.d/flume-ng-agent status
Flume NG agent is not running

sudo /opt/cloudera/parcels/CDH-6.3.3-1.cdh6.3.3.p0.1796617/etc/init.d/flume-ng-agent start
Starting Flume NG agent daemon

sudo /opt/cloudera/parcels/CDH-6.3.3-1.cdh6.3.3.p0.1796617/etc/init.d/flume-ng-agent status
Flume NG agent is running

------***Check the Streaming data***-------
Check on web UI -> Hdfs -> filebrowser -> /user/flume
On worker node terminal cd /user/flume
